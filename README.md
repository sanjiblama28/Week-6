# Managing Dependencies with rosdep

## How do I use the rosdep tool?

We are prepared to use the utility now that we have a basic understanding of rosdep, package.xml, and rosdistro. First, if using rosdep for the first time, it must be initialized using:

```
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
```

We can finally use rosdep install to install dependencies. This is often called once across a workspace that contains numerous packages in order to install all dependencies. If the workspace's root contained the source-code-containing directory src, a call for that might look like the following.

```
rosdep install --from-paths src -y --ignore-src
```

# Creating an action

## Prerequisites

Colcon and ROS 2 must be installed.

Establish a workspace and a package called "action tutorials interfaces":

(Remember to source first from your ROS 2 installation.)

```
mkdir -p ros2_ws/src #you can reuse existing workspace with this naming convention
cd ros2_ws/src
ros2 pkg create action_tutorials_interfaces
```

## Tasks
## 1. Defining an action

Actions are described in .action files with the following format:

```
# Request
---
# Result
---
# Feedback
```
Create a directory called "action" in our ROS 2 package called "action tutorials interfaces":

```
cd action_tutorials_interfaces
mkdir action
```

Make a file called Fibonacci in the action directory. action that includes the following information:

```
int32 order
---
int32[] sequence
---
int32[] partial_sequence
```

## 2. Building an action

The definition of the new Fibonacci action type must be sent to the pipeline that generates Rosidl code before we can use it in our code.

The following lines need be added to our CMakeLists.txt before the ament package() line in the action tutorials interfaces to achieve this:

```
find_package(rosidl_default_generators REQUIRED)

rosidl_generate_interfaces(${PROJECT_NAME}
  "action/Fibonacci.action"
)
```

We must also include the necessary dependencies in our package.xml file:

```
<buildtool_depend>rosidl_default_generators</buildtool_depend>

<depend>action_msgs</depend>

<member_of_group>rosidl_interface_packages</member_of_group>
```

The fact that action definitions contain additional metadata means that we must rely on action msgs (e.g. goal IDs).

The package containing the definition of the Fibonacci action should now be able to be built:

```
# Change to the root of the workspace
cd ~/ros2_ws
# Build
colcon build
```

We are done!

Action types will often start with the term "action" and the package name. As a result, our new action will be referred to by its complete name, action tutorials interfaces/action/Fibonacci.

Using the command line tool, we can verify that our action was built successfully:

```
# Source our workspace
# On Windows: call install/setup.bat
. install/setup.bash
# Check that our action definition exists
ros2 interface show action_tutorials_interfaces/action/Fibonacci
```

The definition of the Fibonacci action should appear on the screen.
